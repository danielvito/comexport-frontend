# Comexport Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0.

## How to use

In the extracted folder, run "npm install" in your terminal/ command prompt to install all dependencies of the projects. This will create the node_modules folder.

Once you did that, simply run "ng serve" or "npm start" to spin up the development server.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
