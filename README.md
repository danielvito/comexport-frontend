# Comexport Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0.

## How to use

In the extracted folder, run "npm install" in your terminal/ command prompt to install all dependencies of the projects. This will create the node_modules folder.

Once you did that, simply run "ng serve" or "npm start" to spin up the development server.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
